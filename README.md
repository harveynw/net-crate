# net

Rust library for communicating with peers over websockets and webrtc.

Designed for games and realtime applications in the browser, which may not require every message to be ordered and reliable.

### Install 

Clone the repo, and then set as dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```bash
cargo add net --path net
```

### Usage

The API is extremely simple:
- ‚û°Ô∏è Send messages by calling .send() on `Server`.
- üîÑ Monitor for messages by emptying an `EventQueue` at whatever frequency your application requires.

Both objects are threadsafe and can be freely cloned.

```rust
use log::info;
use net::{Event, Server};

fn main() {
    let (mut server, mut queue) = Server::new("127.0.0.1:3000");

    loop {
        // Pop events once every tick
        queue
            .pop_all()
            .into_iter()
            .for_each(handle_event);

        // Send message to peer with ID '0' reliably (using a web socket)
        server.send_reliable(0, "hello!".as_bytes().to_vec());
        
        // Send message to the same peer unreliably (using WebRTC data channel)
        server.send_unreliable(0, "hello again!".as_bytes().to_vec());

        // sleep(...)
    }
}

fn handle_event(event: Event) {
    match event {
        Event::Open(id) => info!("Connection opened for {}", id),
        Event::Closed(id) => info!("Connection closed for {}", id),
        Event::Received(id, message) => info!("Received {:?} from {}", message, id)
    }
}
```

### Motivation

With recent improvements in coding agents, there has been a surge in AI-generated web games. However, the multiplayer experience of these demonstrations still tends to be poor. 

This usually, in part, down to the unecessary overhead relying on websockets for communication. WebRTC provides a way to improve on this, supporting unordered and unreliable messaging, but is more complex to setup and usually beyond the abilities of current LLMs to get right. This library provides a simple way to do so, with sensible defaults.

### Connecting as a client

This crate just operates on the server-side. For your frontend, you will need to setup connecting via websockets and accepting signalling messages that the server responds with. 

The [üìÅ clients folder](clients/) contains simple demonstrations for doing this.

##### Typical procedure:
- Client opens websocket connection with the server. Server accepts.
- Server sends an SDP offer and ICE candidate(s) to Client in text-mode.
- Client sends an SDP answer and ICE candidates to the Server in text-mode. 
- If the above succeeds, an `Event::Open` is pushed to the event queue.
- Client/Server exchange messages over websockets in binary-mode, or using the webrct datachannel.
- When either the websocket or webrtc data channel fails/closes, an `Event::Closed` is pushed to the event queue.
